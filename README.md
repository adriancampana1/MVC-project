# Python Application using Flet and MVC Pattern

## Overview

This project is a college assignment aimed at developing a Python application utilizing the Flet framework and adhering to the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. The goal is to create a structured and maintainable codebase, emphasizing separation of concerns and promoting clean code practices.

## Features

-   **MVC Architecture:** Ensures a clear separation between the application's data (Model), user interface (View), and control logic (Controller).
-   **Python and Flet:** Utilizes Python for the core logic and Flet for building interactive user interfaces.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/adriancampana1/MVC-project.git
    cd MVC-project
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

## Usage

1. **Run the application:**

    ```bash
    flet run MVC-project
    ```

2. **Navigate the interface:** Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the application.

## Project Structure

-   **model/**: Contains the data and business logic.
-   **view/**: Handles the presentation layer and user interface.
-   **controller/**: Manages the application's control flow and user input.
